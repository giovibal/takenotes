# Technology stack

First release will use: `angular`, `golang`, `postgres`.

Than switch tecnology for frontend and backend to evaluate performances, productivity and maintainability:

1. `rust` for backend.
2. `react+typescript` or `vue+typescript` for frontend.

Than change architecture, from classic 3 tier to Event Sourcing / CQRS,
to evaluate scalability and extensibility.
N.B. Here we can use cassandra and kafka.
